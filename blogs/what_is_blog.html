            <h2>How to write a blog </h2>
            <p>As this is my first blog, I tried to see how many bloogers write their own blogs. 
                I have seen many programmer blogs. They are so intersting. On behalf of seeing, one 
                thing came to my mind. How many people are struglling in order to wirte their first blog?
                Now its time to share what I read and get from my mini-research. I hope it will help alot. <br>
                I will try to give some reviews.

                <h2>Is blogging just writing something</h2>
                <p>
                    Blogging is many things (that is, if you can actually define what a ‚Äúblog‚Äù is these 
                    days) but a life of feet-up-eating-Nutella-from-a-jar-and-rolling-in-the-dough 
                    it is NOT. <strong>Good, hard-working, revenue generating bloggers:</strong>
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Write every day (even if they aren‚Äôt posting daily, they‚Äôre still building the 
                        habit and writing in one way or another)</li>
                    <li>Connect with other bloggers and build their network</li>
                    <li>Create solutions for the biggest problems their readers bring to them</li>
                    <li>Answer questions and build community via any one or all of the following:

                            <li>Email</li>
                            <li>Facebook ‚Äì their Business Page, public posts, groups</li>
                            <li>Instagram ‚Äì their account and others who tag them</li>

                <h2>What Matters in Your Article</h2>
                <p>
                    Personally, I like to write as if I'm talking to the reader. I use words like ‚ÄúI,‚Äù
                     ‚Äúyou,‚Äù and ‚Äúwe‚Äù in the hopes that it's engaging to readers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Other than that, I try to engage people by asking questions. Sounds hard, right? 
                    Well it really isn't. (See what I did there?) Many people like my style of writing, 
                    but I've also had complaints that my style is too informal, making it difficult to 
                    follow.
                </p>
            </p>
            <p id="quality_vs_quantity">
                <h2>What‚Äôs better: Quality or quantity?</h2>
                <p>
                    If you only focus on quality, you‚Äôll find yourself low on time (i.e. high on burnout) and 
                    low on readership. But if you only focus on quantity, you‚Äôll find yourself low on respect 
                    and ultimately low on sales.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But if you use both together, you are going to get the best of both worlds.
                    My suggestion is to keep a combination of pillar posts and speed posts. Target a niche, 
                    and try to cover all important updates, news, and tutorials in that niche.
                    This will give you a quality blog with a lot of blog posts.
