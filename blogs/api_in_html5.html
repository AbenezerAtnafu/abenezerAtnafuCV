                HTML 5 has more new fantastic API's &quot;. Oh! Then, why don't I read more about it.
               <br><br>
               I will try to give some reviews on the new API's that comes with HTML 5.

                <p>
                    The media API is part of the media element which includes the two, video and audio 
                    elements. There are a number of methods including play(), pause(), load() and 
                    canPlayType(). Combined with additional events and attributes the API allows us to, 
                    amongst other things, create custom controls.

                <p>
                    Blogging is many things (that is, if you can actually define what a ‚Äúblog‚Äù is these 
                    days) but a life of feet-up-eating-Nutella-from-a-jar-and-rolling-in-the-dough 
                    it is NOT. <strong>Good, hard-working, revenue generating bloggers:</strong>

                <h2>What Matters in Your Article</h2>
                <p>
                    Personally, I like to write as if I'm talking to the reader. I use words like ‚ÄúI,‚Äù
                     ‚Äúyou,‚Äù and ‚Äúwe‚Äù in the hopes that it's engaging to readers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Other than that, I try to engage people by asking questions. Sounds hard, right? 
                    Well it really isn't. (See what I did there?) Many people like my style of writing, 
                    but I've also had complaints that my style is too informal, making it difficult to 
                    follow.
                </p>
            </p>
            <p id="quality_vs_quantity">
                <h2>What‚Äôs better: Quality or quantity?</h2>
                <p>
                    If you only focus on quality, you‚Äôll find yourself low on time (i.e. high on burnout) and 
                    low on readership. But if you only focus on quantity, you‚Äôll find yourself low on respect 
                    and ultimately low on sales.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But if you use both together, you are going to get the best of both worlds.
                    My suggestion is to keep a combination of pillar posts and speed posts. Target a niche, 
                    and try to cover all important updates, news, and tutorials in that niche.
                    This will give you a quality blog with a lot of blog posts.
